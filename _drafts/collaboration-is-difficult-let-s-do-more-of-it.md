As proud members of LocalGov Digital we've been flying the flag of collaboration for some time. Put simply, as a small team with limited capacity, skills and funding we can't hope to make as big an impact as we'd like by working alone. It's why our first Digital Strategy had a [core principle of collaboration](https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/strategy/collaboration.html), and our replacement Customer, Digital and Technology Strategy will continue that commitment.

We've had minor success to date in working with Democracy Club [on their polling station finder](https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/blog/2017/05/17/collaboration-not-reinvention), and with Kings Lynn & West Norfolk in using their skills to [develop a new Contact Us page]().

But it's always been a tricky thing to start. How do you find out who is doing what? How do you get involved? How do you start something and get others to join you?

The collaborative working environment in the public sector has taken off recently giving rise to great opportunities for us to capitalise on. We've seen

* the re-birth of [Pipeline](https://pipeline.localgov.digital), through a LocalGov Digital/Hackney collaboration, to help councils connect with each other on projects they are working on
*  the opening up of Government as a Platform services like GOV.Pay and GOV.Notify [to all local authorities in June 2018](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2018/07/05/notify-pay-local-authorities/) . With 60 of them taking up the use of GOV.Notify already it's proving to be very attractive.
* the launch of the [Local Digital team](https://localdigital.gov.uk/about/) within the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) with the express purpose of facilitating collaboration and move the work of central and local government closer together
* the [announcement in July 2018 of the creation of a Â£7.5m fund](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/07/04/why-mhclg-is-backing-a-local-government-digital-revolution/) to help local authorities build common solutions to shared problems.

Perhaps the most exciting development is the collaborative work starting between [local authorities and the GOV.Pay team](https://localdigital.gov.uk/eoi/north-east-lincolnshire-council-nelc-4/). The plan is to see how the product can be developed to fill the gap between taking payments and reconciling these with local authority finance systems. If successful this could save a significant amount of money in councils buying commercial third party products. We're looking to collaborate on this discovery work too with North Lincolnshire, albeit in a 'light touch' only capacity

## Local Digital Fund

In September the Local Digital Team opened the Expression of Interest stage for bids against the Local Digital Fund. 

No one was sure quite what the scale of the response would but the 382 submissions received from 171 organisations took many by surprise

Many councils submitting multiple bids (Southwark entered 13. The average was 2.2 per local authority). The [quality and ambition of these was varied](http://philrumens.blogspot.com/2018/10/doing-few-good-things-well.html), but it showed the massive interest in working together to resolve issues.

## Our Local Digital Fund application

### Expression of Interest

We decided to put together an exploratory bid to the Local Digital Fund for some work we were interested in starting on chatbots and AI.

Like a lot of authorities, we'd starting to look at this capability as another tool in our set for automating straightforward tasks, improving service to our customers and reducing costs. We'd started to look at Dialogflow as a potential platform, but then we realised we were starting down the path of individualisation.

Wouldn't it be better if we had a common approach? What if all councils used the _same_ platform, used a _common_ process library and managed it _themselves_ as a sector? Wouldn't that be breaking the mould?

We realised that as we didn't have any user research at all and we'd need to do some legwork to find out more. So we put an (ambitious) concept together as [an expression of interest ](https://localdigital.gov.uk/eoi/oxford-city-council/)to put this concept into practice. 

At the time of submission on 5 October we struggled to find anyone to join us, and thought this would mean the bid would get nowhere. 

### Invitation to Apply 

On 16 October we were pleasantly surprised to get not one but _two_ emails confirming we'd been invited to make a full application. Each was an invitation for a category;

* **Chatbots, artificial intelligence or robotic process automation** with six other councils
* **Local government as a platform**, with nine other councils

After a bit of back-slapping we realised we were still in the same situation as before with no partners.
