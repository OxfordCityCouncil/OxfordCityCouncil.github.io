As proud members of LocalGov Digital we've been flying the flag of collaboration for some time. Put simply, as a small team with limited capacity, skills and funding we can't hope to make as big an impact as we'd like by working alone. It's why our first Digital Strategy had a core principle of collaboration, and our replacement Customer, Digital and Technology Strategy will continue that commitment.

But it's always been a tricky thing to start. How do you find out who is doing what? How do you get involved? How do you start something and get others to join you?

## Pipeline

LocalGov Digital created Pipeline some years ago as a means for councils to share what they were working on and encourage others to join them. 

The excellent LocalGov Digital Pipeline project has recently been given a new lease of life by the team at [Hackney](https://blogs.hackney.gov.uk/hackit/pipeline). At the time of writing this blog, 36 organisations were sharing information on 54 projects, and that will only increase as word is spread.
