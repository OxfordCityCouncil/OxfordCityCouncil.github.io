As proud members of LocalGov Digital we've been flying the flag of collaboration for some time. Put simply, as a small team with limited capacity, skills and funding we can't hope to make as big an impact as we'd like by working alone. It's why our first Digital Strategy had a core principle of collaboration, and our replacement Customer, Digital and Technology Strategy will continue that commitment.

We've had minor success to date in working with Democracy Club on their polling station finder, and with Kings Lynn & West Norfolk in using their skills to [develop a new Contact Us page](). 

But it's always been a tricky thing to start. How do you find out who is doing what? How do you get involved? How do you start something and get others to join you?

The collaborative working environment in the public sector has taken off recently giving rise to great opportunities for us to capitalise on. 

## Pipeline

LocalGov Digital created [Pipeline](https://pipeline.localgov.digital) some years ago as a means for councils to share what they were working on and to encourage others to join them. Unfortunately, it didn't get the traction it needed to be a focus for collaborative working - perhaps being ahead of its time.

It has recently been given a new lease of life by the team at [Hackney](https://blogs.hackney.gov.uk/hackit/pipeline). At the time of writing this blog, 36 organisations were sharing information on 54 projects, and that will only increase as word is spread and more project take hold.

To date we've not shared our work on Pipeline, but we'll be revisiting this as we start to move into newer areas of work like Robotic Process Automation and Chatbots/AI, where we know others are starting their own work too. 

## Government as a Platform

The concept of shared, high quality digital capabilities was one limited to central government, but this is changing. 

In June 2017, GOV.Pay and GOV.Notify were available only to local authorities taking part in carefully curated pilot projects. In June this year their use was thrown open to any local authorities to use. With 60 of them taking up the use of GOV.Notify

Perhaps the most exciting development is collaborative work between local authorities and the GOV.Pay team to see how the product can be developed 

## Local Digital Fund

A new Local Digital team has been set up with the express intent of facilitating collaboration and move the work of central and local government closer together
