As proud members of LocalGov Digital we've been flying the flag of collaboration for some time. Put simply, as a small team with limited capacity, skills and funding we can't hope to make as big an impact as we'd like by working alone. It's why our first Digital Strategy had a [core principle of collaboration](https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/strategy/collaboration.html), and our replacement Customer, Digital and Technology Strategy will continue that commitment.

We've had minor success to date in working with Democracy Club [on their polling station finder](https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/blog/2017/05/17/collaboration-not-reinvention), and with Kings Lynn & West Norfolk in using their skills to [develop a new Contact Us page]().

But it's always been a tricky thing to start. How do you find out who is doing what? How do you get involved? How do you start something and get others to join you?

The collaborative working environment in the public sector has taken off recently giving rise to great opportunities for us to capitalise on. Here's a recap:

## Pipeline

LocalGov Digital created [Pipeline](https://pipeline.localgov.digital) some years ago as a means for councils to share what they were working on and to encourage others to join them. Unfortunately, it didn't get the traction it needed to be a focus for collaborative working - perhaps being ahead of its time.

It has recently been given a new lease of life by the team at [Hackney](https://blogs.hackney.gov.uk/hackit/pipeline). At the time of writing this blog, 36 organisations were sharing information on 54 projects, and that will only increase as word is spread and more project take hold.

To date we've not shared our work on Pipeline, but we'll be revisiting this as we start to move into newer areas of work like Robotic Process Automation and Chatbots/AI, where we know others are starting their own work, and the need for collaboration is high.

## Government as a Platform

The concept of high quality digital capabilities developed centrally and available to others was once limited to central government, but this is changing.

In June 2017, GOV.Pay and GOV.Notify were made available only to local authorities taking part in carefully curated pilot projects. In June this year their use was [thrown open to all local authorities to use](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2018/07/05/notify-pay-local-authorities/). With 60 of them taking up the use of GOV.Notify, and with its rates for SMS the lowest available, it's proving to be very attractive.

We've started to experiment with GOV.Notify for a service in development, and may also be using the bulk upload option for a batch email reminder to some residents soon.

Perhaps the most exciting development is the collaborative work starting between [local authorities and the GOV.Pay team](https://localdigital.gov.uk/eoi/north-east-lincolnshire-council-nelc-4/). The plan is to see how the product can be developed to fill the gap between taking payments and reconciling these with local authority finance systems. If successful this could save a significant amount of money in councils buying commercial third party products. We're looking to collaborate on this discovery work too with North Lincolnshire, albeit in a 'light touch' only capacity

## Local Digital Fund

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) [announced in July 2018 the creation of a Â£7.5m fund](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/07/04/why-mhclg-is-backing-a-local-government-digital-revolution/) to help local authorities build common solutions to shared problems.

A new [Local Digital team](https://localdigital.gov.uk/about/) has been set up with the express purpose of facilitating collaboration and move the work of central and local government closer together

In September it opened the Expression of Interest stage and received 382 submissions from 171 organisations, many submitting multiple bids (Southwark entered 13. The average was 2.2 per local authority). The [quality and ambition of these is varied](http://philrumens.blogspot.com/2018/10/doing-few-good-things-well.html), but it shows the massive interest in working together to resolve issues.

## Our Local Digital Fund application

### Expression of Interest

We decided to put together an exploratory bid to the Local Digital Fund for some work we were interested in starting on chatbots and AI.

Like a lot of authorities, we'd starting to look at this capability as another tool in our set for automating straightforward tasks, improving service to our customers and reducing costs. We'd started to look at Dialogflow as a potential platform, but then we realised we were starting down the path of individualisation.

Wouldn't it be better if we had a common approach? What if all councils used the _same_ platform, used a _common_ process library and managed it _themselves_ as a sector? Wouldn't that be breaking the mould?

We realised that as we didn't have any user research at all and we'd need to do some legwork to find out more. So we put an (ambitious) concept together as [an expression of interest ](https://localdigital.gov.uk/eoi/oxford-city-council/)to put this concept into practice. 

At the time of submission we struggled to find anyone to join us. 

### Invitation to Apply 

but since then we've had 10 other councils collaborate with us in developing the full application.
