excerpt: Our journey in researching, developing and launching a new approach, only
  to scrap it later

As part of our ongoing set of performance metrics for our website we keep a close eye on satisfaction, using GovMetric as our main page-level feedback tool.

## How it started

When we were developing our website in 2015, we took the opportunity to change our approach to content; we knew that our pages were too broad in topic and difficult to read. 

Particular pages came in for attention, including our Contact Us page. At that time

## What we learned

* We didn't do enough to research what our users really wanted
* When we were told, we put business needs ahead of user needs
* There is no-off-the-shelf solution that works for everyone
* User needs in one part of the country do not seem to translate automatically to other areas.
