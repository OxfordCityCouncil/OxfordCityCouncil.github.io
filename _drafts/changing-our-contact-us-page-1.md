excerpt: Our journey in researching, developing and launching a new approach, only
  to scrap it later

As part of our ongoing set of [performance metrics for our website ](https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/performance/webtraffic.html)we keep a close eye on satisfaction, using [GovMetric](https://www.govmetric.com/how-it-works.html) as our main page-level feedback tool.

Our Contact Us page has had a chequered past and has received a good deal of attention, but we're not yet at the end of this journey.

## Where we started

When we were developing our website in 2015, we took the opportunity to change our approach to content.

We'd benefitted from a content audit from our developers, [Jadu](www.jadu.net), along with some guidance on content strategy. One element of this was using our site to reduce avoidable contact.

Our Contact Us page presented to users as [a long list of phone numbers and email addresses](//downloads/Old Homepage_small.jpg); we were essentially encouraging users to abandon our site and contact us by other channels, avoiding our Contact Centre staff.

## Our first changes

Our initial changes were guided more by not repeating the past than by any focus on user needs; the long list of phone numbers and email addresses was replaced by a minimalist set of entries in a contact hierarchy of online, phone and in person.

At the same time we were aware that there had been a call for a single email address for the council. Our Customer Service team  resisted this approach, as a previous attempt to use one had resulted in a deluge of general enquiries that needed significant staff time to categorise and forward to the most appropriate service.

The new Contact Us page was launched as part of the new site in January 2016 with a generic Contact Us form, using service categories to help speed up the processing of the responses. Without a corporate customer service email address, all submissions were forwarded to the webmaster address looked after by our team.

After 8 days we'd received 107 form submissions, which outstripped our ability to handle them and reflected users were defaulting to email rather than using the rest of the site. Things had to change, and we took down the form link.

So we needed to rethink. Meanwhile the Contact Us page stayed in its new minimalist form. 

## What feedback told us

When reviewed in March 2017 the  Contact Us page accounted for 320 feedback submissions (the 2nd highest ranked pages with feedback) and was the single highest area of dissatisfaction with the website

Its percentage of overall website dissatisfaction for the previous four months was;

* February 2017 - 17%
* January 2017 - 16%
* December 2016 - 9%
* November 2016 - 10%

58 submissions had commented on their reasons for dissatisfaction, which were;

* Lack of contact information/hard to find (39%)
* General enquiry/miscellaneous comment (26%)
* Mentions need for general email address/enquiry form (21%)
* Problem with website generally (14%)

Exit rates for the Contact Us page were as high as 52%, suggesting users were being driven to the telephone. 

## Options we considered

We explored the Contact pages used by 14 different organisations to get a range of options to consider. These fell broadly into x categories;

1. Using A-Z pages to supplement navigation and provide contact information, such as [Birmingham's](https://www.birmingham.gov.uk/a_to_z)
2. Developing a better generic contact form, such as [Hounslow's](https://eforms.hounslow.gov.uk/ufs/ufsmain?formid=ENQUIRIES_FORM&ebz=1_1541709239564&ebd=0&ebz=1_1541709239564)
3. Using an interactive query form to provide drill-down functionality to better match a userâ€™s requirements, such as [Worcestershire's](https://capublic.worcestershire.gov.uk/CSAPortalPublic/)
4. Returning to a full contact list, albeit better presented, such as [Bristol's](https://www.bristol.gov.uk/contact)

## What we learned

* We didn't do enough to research what our users really wanted
* When we were told, we put business needs ahead of user needs
* There is no-off-the-shelf solution that works for everyone
* User needs in one part of the country do not seem to translate automatically to other areas.
