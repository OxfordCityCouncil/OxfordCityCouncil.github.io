excerpt: Our journey in researching, developing and launching a new approach, only
  to scrap it later

As part of our ongoing set of [performance metrics for our website ](https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/performance/webtraffic.html)we keep a close eye on satisfaction, using [GovMetric](https://www.govmetric.com/how-it-works.html) as our main page-level feedback tool.

## How we started

When we were developing our website in 2015, we took the opportunity to change our approach to content. 

We'd benefitted from a content audit from our developers, [Jadu](www.jadu.net), along with some guidance on content strategy. One element of this was using our site to reduce avoidable contact. 

Our Contact Us page presented to users as a long list of phone numbers and email addresses; we were essentially encouraging users to abandon our site and contact us by other channels, avoiding our Contact Centre staff. 

## Options we considered

## What we learned

* We didn't do enough to research what our users really wanted
* When we were told, we put business needs ahead of user needs
* There is no-off-the-shelf solution that works for everyone
* User needs in one part of the country do not seem to translate automatically to other areas.
