This week we finished the first stage of a project with our colleagues in Council Tax.

## Auditing our content

We had already decided that a major project for the next two years was to review all our website content, review its performance and rewrite/add/delete where needed to ensure we were meeting user needs.

We also knew from our [LocalDigital Chatbot project](https://localdigitalchatbots.github.io/2019/04/22/project-completion-looking-at-what-we-ve-done/#user-research) that we can make a big difference to a user journey by focusing on better web content. It also has the advantage of being quick and free to do!

After a few attempts at a full-year site-wide analysis using Analytics data we realised we weren't making much progress. Our cookie opt-out has seen a [50% drop in recorded web traffic](https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/performance/webtraffic.html) and edits to pages through the year resulted in multiple entries for the same page. Also, with the sheer volume of content to analyse we were in a 'can't see the wood for the trees' scenario.

We needed to find a better way.

## A team-by-team approach

Our Head of Service was keen to promote a service-wide approach to helping team improvement rather than just picking off individual elements (such as web content). This worked well for us as we could shape our audit work around a single team, and also look a bit wider to see things in context.

The fabulous Laura Griffiths from [Basis](https://www.basis.co.uk/about-us) was drafted in to help us shape our approach, and the Council Tax team were selected as the ideal guinea pigs to start with due to their commitment to improvement and positive attitude to change. This gave us 10 days of consultancy input to use.

Our now refocused audit piece concentrated on:

* identifying all content and content types leading from the council tax landing page to show its volume and structure
* Page performance data on a month-by month basis to show seasonal trends and compensate for Analytics drop-off

## Fast scoping

A kick-off meeting was held with main players from our team, Customer Contact and Council Tax to talk through what everyone saw as the problems facing the service.

One of the main issues was the 'backlog' of work (the time between receiving a communication from users and completing it) which has been as high as six weeks. The reasons for this delay were suggested as being:

* repeat contact (chasing up submitted eforms)
* requests for additional information not supplied (esp for email contact)
* the volume of contact

Laura developed two hypotheses to be tested:

* "Removing email as a channel choice for customers will reduce the backlog and decrease unnecessary contact"
* "Allocating a mix of the oldest contacts and newest contacts will eliminate the backlog"

## Discovery phase

We developed a set of personas for users of the service to help us examine user journeys to identify how well user needs were being met.

We found some oddities on the journey for our online forms:

* confirmation messages for completed submissions included comments on the size of the backlog. While it's good to help expectations around response times, this suggests the backlog had become almost commonplace/accepted
* there were also messages to promote registering to vote for our Moving In form which we traced back to a push on this from a few years ago. We felt there were other things we could include her to help people moving into the area (especially students)
* we realised our site-wide webchat didn't extend across our forms pages

We also 

## Deep dive on data

What we found was:

* The most popular website action was paying council tax online, with 87% of users finding the page within 3 clicks and 73% of users reaching it within 20 seconds.
*
