This week we finished the first stage of a project with our colleagues in Council Tax. 

## Auditing our content

We had already decided that a major project for the next two years was to review all our website content, review its performance and rewrite/add/delete where needed to ensure we were meeting user needs. 

We also knew from our [LocalDigital Chatbot project](https://localdigitalchatbots.github.io/2019/04/22/project-completion-looking-at-what-we-ve-done/#user-research) that we can make a big difference to a user journey by focusing on better web content. It also has the advantage of being quick and free to do!

After a few attempts at a full-year site-wide analysis using Analytics data we realised we weren't making much progress. Our cookie opt-out has seen a [50% drop in recorded web traffic](https://digital.oxford.gov.uk/performance/webtraffic.html) and edits to pages through the year resulted in multiple entries for the same page. Also, with the sheer volume of content to analyse we were in a 'can't see the wood for the trees' scenario. We needed to find a better way. 

## A team-by-team approach

Our Head of Service was keen to promote a holistic approach to helping service improvement rather than just picking off individual elements (such as web content). This worked well for us as we could shape our audit work around a single team.

The fabulous Laura Griffiths from [Basis](https://www.basis.co.uk/about-us) was drafted in to help us shape our approach, and the Council Tax team were selected as the ideal guinea pigs to start with due to their commitment to improvement and positive attitude to change.

A now refocused audit piece concentrated on:

* identifying all content and content types leading from the council tax landing page
*
