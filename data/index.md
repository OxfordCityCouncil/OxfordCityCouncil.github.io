Here is some intro text about what we want to do

## Open Data Communities
* Bristol has a thriving Open Data community of [over 250 members](https://www.meetup.com/Bristol_Open_Data/) 
* [Bath: Hacked](https://www.bathhacked.org/about/) is a joint council/community initiative that aims to put open data and smart thinking at the heart of the city.
