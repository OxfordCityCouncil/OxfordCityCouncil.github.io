Part of the [collaboration theme in our Digital Strategy](http://digital.oxford.gov.uk/strategy/collaboration) talks about making our data open so that people can make their own informed choices.

We sometimes have good reasons to keep things to ourselves, like personal privacy issues, data protection requirements, commercial confidentiality and data licensing. However, these are often the exception and it can actually end up creating more work and reducing trust.

That's why the Digital Development Team is following the Government Digital Service design principle of ['make things open: it makes things better'](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#tenth).

## How we work in the open

* We publish our [Digital Strategy](http://digital.oxford.gov.uk/strategy) on this site as HTML rather than a PDF. This has the benefit of allowing us to update statistics as they change, but most importantly it means it's easier to find and read on any device.

* We publish our [Digital Strategy Action Plan](https://trello.com/b/0vAY7BH1) and our [team workplan](https://trello.com/b/kJc0dcpl/2017-18-workplan) on Trello so that everyone can see what we are doing. We think this is a smarter way to work as people can subscribe to updates if they want to keep up with actions as they change. It also keeps us on our toes as we know others are watching! We're encouraging more of our colleagues to start using digital tools like this through leading by example.

* We [publish our performance metrics](http://digital.oxford.gov.uk/performance) so that it's easier for the public and our colleagues to see how we are improving. We also have a [live Google Analytics page](http://oxcitylive.herokuapp.com/) so that anyone can see what is happening on our main website. Our Customer Service colleagues are also [reporting their performance](https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20168/performance/671/customer_service_performance) (it's catching!)

* We use a public [website uptime monitoring](https://www.oxford.gov.uk/status) from [Rapidspike]() so people can check if any of our services are down. This also makes sense from a business continuity perspective, as anyone can check for problems at any location or time of day.

* We use [GitHub](https://github.com/OxfordCityCouncil) to store our code, and where we can we make this openly accessible. We started with our website templates so people working with us to created themed sites for us can easy access them.

* We are working with our [Smart Oxford partners](https://www.oxfordsmartcity.uk/cgi-bin/index.pl) to run an [open data platform](https://www2.oxopendata.uk).

* We pubished our [Digital Design Standards](http://digital.oxford.gov.uk/standards)

* We run [this microsite](http://digital.oxford.gov.uk) on GitHub pages as it's free, easy to use and open.
