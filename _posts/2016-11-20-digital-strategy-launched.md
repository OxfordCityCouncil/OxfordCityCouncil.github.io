On 17 November the City Council's City Executive Board signed off on its first [Digital Strategy](../strategy/index.html).

The Strategy is formed around five principles;

* Promoting [Inclusion](../strategy/inclusion.html): Ensuring everyone has the capability to access and use digital services to do things that can benefit them day to day
* Putting the [Customer in Control](../strategy/customer-in-control.html): Enabling our customers to engage with us in ways that best suit them
* [Supporting Business Growth](../strategy/supporting-business-growth.html)</a>: Supporting local economic growth by improving digital infrastructure and partnering with business to exploit new digital opportunities
* Using [Collaboration](../strategy/collaboration.html): Achieving better outcomes through working together, sharing good practice and making our data open by default
