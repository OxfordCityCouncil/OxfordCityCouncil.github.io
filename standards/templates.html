<p>We aim to give users as consistent and seamless a journey as possible as they use our different digital services. Our preference is to always use our design template to theme third party sites or web applications. All sites and web applications that use an oxford.gov.uk sub-domain are required to use this template.</p>

<p>Our site template, containing all design images, css and javascript, can be forked from our GitHub repository</p>
