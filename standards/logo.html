<h2>Position</h2>
<p>The Council logo must always appear on branded websites in the position set in the template (on the right in the masthead). The vertical line of the logo should extend to the top of the screen. </p>

<p>For partner websites, or commercial Council services that have their own branding (such as <a href="https://www.oxforddirectservices.co.uk">Oxford Direct Services</a> or <a href="http://www.oxfordtownhall.co.uk">Oxford Town Hall</a>) the logo is placed in the footer on the right hand side.</p>

<h2>Logo file</h2>
<p>The <a href="templates.html">template file</a> contains an .svg and a .png version of the logo for use. The .svg file is preferred.</p>

<p>The custom.css file contains an amended link to the .png file (commented out) should it be required instead.</p>
