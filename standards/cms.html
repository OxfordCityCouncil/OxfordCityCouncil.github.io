title: Website CMS
---

<p>We uses <a href="http://www.jadu.net/cms">Jadu CMS</a> as as our main content management system for content-focused websites. This is so;</p>
<ul>
  <li>they can be deployed easily within our existing hosting arrangements</li>
  <li>they are covered by existing support arrangements</li>
  <li>they can be maintained and extended by the Digital Development Team</li>
</ul>

<p>Staff are already trained and supported in developing content using JaduCMS.</p>

<p>We use a custom-made responsive template for our subsites that can be adapted to be branded or unbranded. You can see examples of this in use for <a href="https://www.oxforddirectservices.co.uk/">Oxford Direct Services</a> and <a href="http://www.oxfordtownhall.co.uk/">Oxford Town Hall</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Other Content Management Systems</h2>
<p>We want to promote the use of open source CMS where we can, and so prefer any single-purpose microsites that cannot be deployed in Jadu CMS should be built in;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drupal 7; or</li>
  <li>Wordpress</li>
</ul>
<p>To make sure these can be taken on and supported after development we require developers to;
<ul>
	<li>Host the source code on a repository to which we have access (preferably GitHub)</li>
	<li>Host the site using an account we can take over for ongoing maintenance</li>
	<li>Use our <a href="dns">domain name allocation arrangements</a></li>
</ul>
