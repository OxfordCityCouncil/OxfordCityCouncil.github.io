title: Website CMS
---

<p>We currently use <a href="http://www.jadu.net/cms">Jadu CMS</a> as our content management system for our main website, and will use this as a default for any new initiative requiring a content-only web presence . This is because;</p>
<ul>
  <li>the existing web estate is already large and creating further sites generates a technical overhead;</li>
<li>the Council brand/identity is well established, and the design meets accessibility requirements</li>
  <li>the site is covered by existing support arrangements</li>
  <li>information can be maintained and extended by Council, with staff training in using the CMS</li>
</ul>

<p>We use a custom-made responsive template for our subsites that can be adapted to be branded or unbranded. You can see examples of this in use for <a href="https://www.goultralowoxford.org/">Go Ultra Low Oxford</a> and <a href="http://www.oxfordtownhall.co.uk/">Oxford Town Hall</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Other Content Management Systems</h2>
<p>Only where there are strong reasons not to use our main website will we look to create websites in other content management systems</p>
<p>We want to promote the use of open source CMS where we can, and so prefer any single-purpose microsites to be built in;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Drupal 7; or</li>
  <li>Wordpress</li>
</ul>
<p>To make sure these can be taken on and supported after development we require developers to;
<ul>
	<li>Host the source code on a repository to which we have access (preferably GitHub)</li>
	<li>Host the site using an account we can take over for ongoing maintenance. For Wordpress sites we have our own hosting arrangements</li>
	<li>Use our <a href="dns">domain name allocation arrangements to ensure the Council owns and maintains any domain names</a></li>
</ul>
