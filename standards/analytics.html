<h2>Analytics</h2>
<p>As a minimum we use Google Analytics tracking on our sites to find out how well we are meeting customer needs, to find out more about customer behaviour and to learn how we can improve our services.</p>

<p>We expect any new sites or applications to be able to provide us with access to analytics data, or (preferrably) for developers to install our tracking code on their sites.</p>

<p>The Digital Development Team can set up a Google Analytics container for your website or application and provide tracking code on request.</p>


<h2>Tracking performance</h2>
<p>We also need to know how well our web applications are performing so we can judge how well they are delivering our services. For instance, as a minimum we will need a means to measure the number of completed transactions</p>
<p>Individual applications will identify the metrics necessary to measure their success, and their is an expectation that developers will work to accommodate these as part of their solutions.</p>
