<p>We aim to ensure that our customers can complete any online transaction the first time unaided. It is important that any online forms are high quality, accessible, easy to use and built around customer needs. They should only ask for information required to successfully complete the transaction and not gather superfluous information.</p>
<p></p>

<h2>Design Patterns</h2>
<p>The general design of form elements should follow the <a href="http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/form-elements/"> GOV.UK Form Elements guidance</a> while adapting to the Oxford City Council style template.</p>

<p>The design of individual form questions (e.g. date fields, addresses) should follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/index.html">GOV.UK Design Patterns</a> as these have been thoroughly tested with users to achieve consistently good results.</p>
<p>Although not definitive, we would also suggest developers make use of the <a href="https://designpatterns.hackpad.com/Design-patterns-0eUk1OdHvql">Design Patterns hackpad</a> to draw on for their solutions as this is continually being added to.</p>

<h2>Web Forms Design Guidance</h2>
<p>In 2014 we asked <a href="http://www.mando.agency">Mando</a> to help us improve our online forms. They tested each one and also undertook user testing on a representative sample. The outcomes of this were captured in a guidance document to assist us and developers that work with us to create great digital services.</p>

<p>Although the guidance document represented the best available advice at the time, we're aware that it can now contradict the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/index.html">GOV.UK Design Patterns</a> in places. An example is section 2.9 relating to progress indicators. In these cases, the GOV.UK advice takes priority over our guidance document.</p>
