<p>We subscribe to the Local Government Digital Service Standard as a methodology to developing our digital services. This is based on the Government Digital Service's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Digital Service Standard</a>, but adapted to better suit local government.</p>

<p><a target="-blank" href="http://localgovdigital.info/localgov-digital-makers/outputs/local-government-digital-service-standard/">Local Government Digital Service Standard</a></p>

<p>This sets expectations on us as well as on external developers working with it. The focus is on ensuring that customer needs remain paramount, that teams delivering digital services are effective, and that an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-government-services-introduction">agile</a> approach is used to deploy on an iterative basis using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research">feedback from users</a>.</p>
