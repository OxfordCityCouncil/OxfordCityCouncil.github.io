title: Browsers & Accessibility
---

<p>Your web application or digital service must be must be universally accessible, with a responsive design that works on all devices.</p>

<p>Javascript is acceptable, but the service must be able to operate should it be unavailable (i.e. through user choice or network issues/restrictions). Similarly, the service should be able to display sufficient information to be used by users should css styling not be available.</p>

<h2>Browser compatability</h2>
<p>You will need to ensure your web application or digital service is compatible with the browsers specified by the Government Digital Service at their <a href="
https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices">designing for different browsers and devices</a> page.</p>

<p>This relates to use of GOV.UK websites, which may not reflect local use in Oxford, but we think they are a good baseline to use.</p>

<p>Also, bear in mind that Council staff use IE9 as a default browser due to compatibilty issues with some legacy IT systems.</p>

<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>We aim to be an inclusive Council where no one is left behind. We require a minimum Level AA compliance with Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) accessibility guidelines</p>

<p>For practical guidance, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/developing.html">WIA Tips on Developing for Web Accessibility</a></p>

<p>Other practical guidance is available from the Home Office posters on web accessibility available on their <a href="https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility">Github site</a>.</p>
