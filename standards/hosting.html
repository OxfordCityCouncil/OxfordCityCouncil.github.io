<h2>Council-hosted services</h2>
<p>For software and data to be hosted on Council servers, our project manager will give details of how to work with our infrastructure hosts, SCC.</p>

<h2>Website hosting</h2>
<p>We have arrangements in place with Arcus Global for hosting, and this would be our preferred solution.</p>

<h2>Location of data centres</h2>
<p>In order to comply with the Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) in that personal data may only be transferred to third countries if that country provides an adequate level of protection.</p>
<p>The practical implication of this is that we will only accept storage of such data within EU data centres.</p>
