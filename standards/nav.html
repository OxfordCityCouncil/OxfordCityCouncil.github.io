<p>Navigation using our template is provided through the following elements;</p>
<ul>
	<li>The site name (defaulting to the home page)</li>
	<li>The LHS Navigation bar</li>
	<li>The Breadcrumbs banner</li>
	<li>The Footer</li>
	<li>Landing page navigation links</li>
</ul>

<h2>Site name</h2>
<p>For external sites using a sub-domain, this must always navigate to the main council website at https://www.oxford.gov.uk</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>Navigation bar</h2>
<p>Use of the navigational bar is mandatory in the <a href="two-col.html">two column layout</a> and should carry the hyperlinks set in the <a href="templates.html">template</a>.</p>
<p>Changing the navigation links in the navigation bar is subject to approval.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Breadcrumbs</h2>
<p>Hierarchical navigation should be represented in the breadcrumbs banner, with hyperlinks to the parent hierarchy. The first element must always be home. The last element must match the page title in the h1 banner</p>
<p>Each element is separated by a "/"</p>
<p>e.g. Home / Hierarchy 1 / Hierarchy 2 / Page title</p>

<p>When using a branded sub-domain your application landing page will need to reflect the navigation of the related pages on the Council's main website. For example, our parking fines web application at <a href="https://parking.oxford.gov.uk/parking/">https://parking.oxford.gov.uk/parking/</a> has the following breadcrumb for its landing page;</p>

<p>     <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/">Home</a>  / <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20012/parking_and_travel">Parking and Travel</a> / <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20078/parking_in_oxford">Parking in Oxford</a> / <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/info/20078/parking_in_oxford/494/pay_your_parking_fine">Pay your Parking Fine</a> / Parking Fines</p>

<p>The Digital Development Team will give advice on which links to use.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Footer</h2>
<p>Use of the footer is mandatory in either layout and carries the correct hyperlinks for the main council website.</p>

<h2>Landing page navigation links</h2>
<p>An example of this type of link is shown on the <a href="headers.html">page elements</a></p>
<p>These are to be used in in groups. They can be used in single column (if no more than 5 links) or in two columns (greater than 5 links, with each column equally balanced in number)</p>
<p>No other text or information should be used on the page with these navigation links</p>
