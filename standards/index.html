description: Oxford City Council's digital standards are guidance for external developers it works with in developing digital services
---

<p>This is a set of guidance for external developers working with Oxford City Council in developing digital services, and also a reference site for staff engaged in designing and developing digital services.</p>

<p>The guidance here is around front-end development as our priority is on creating an excellent customer experience. Technical guidance and project methodology will arise from interactions with one of our project managers.</p>

<h2>Our objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To provide digital services that can be completed successfully by the user first time unaided</li>
  <li>To make the customer experience so good that the user will prefer to use the digital service over non-digital channels</li>
  <li>To meet the Council's ambitions to deliver reliable and successful digital services</li>
</ul>

<h2>Definitions</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Digital service: </strong>any service required by a user (such as ‘reporting a pothole’) that is delivered by the internet and is largely or entirely automated so that it requires minimal human intervention to be processed. This includes web sites as well as web-based applications.</li>
  <li><strong>User: </strong>anyone that interacts with or uses the digital service. This can include staff as well as customers. 'User' is used because 'customer' implies that there is a choice in using the service, which is not always the case.</li>
</ul>
