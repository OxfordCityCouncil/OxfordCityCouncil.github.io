<p>The content within a web application or website is as important as any of its functionality. Poorly written or confusing content will frustrate users and inhibit our objective of providing digital services that can be completed successfully by the user first time unaided.</p>

<p>We subscribe to the <a href="http://localgovdigital.info/localgov-digital-makers/outputs/digital-content-standards/">LocalGovDigital web content guidance</a> which aims to achieve consistently high standards in web content.</p>

<p>The Digital Development Team can provide advice and guidance on developing appropriate content, and will expect to sign off on this prior to launch.</p>
