<div class="subtitle">
    Ensuring everyone has the capability to access and use digital services to do things that can benefit them day to day
</div>

<p>Being digitally capable can make a significant difference to individuals, through being able to cut household bills, find a job, or maintain contact with distant friends and relatives. It can also provide broader benefits, by helping to address wider social and economic issues like reducing isolation and supporting economic growth.</p>

<h2>Where we are now</h2>
<p>We have taken steps in the last year to improve our accessibility and be more inclusive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Our new website uses <a href="https://www.texthelp.com/en-us/products/browsealoud">Browsealoud</a> to assist visitors with visual impairments, reading difficulties or English as a second language</li>
    <li>We ensure that new web design meets AA accessibility standards</li>
    <li>We have re-written all our web pages to make them shorter, more to the point and using plain English</li>
</ul>
<p>However, our <a href="https://betterconnected.socitm.net/councils/oxford-city">SOCITM Better Connected survey rating for accessibility</a> shows we need to improve further.<p>

<p>While regional statistics present a positive picture of digital inclusion in Oxford, we know from our customer insight work that a significant number are either not ready or not able to move to using digital services over other channels. Within our own workforce there are differing levels of digital skills.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy">Government’s Digital Inclusion Strategy</a> sets out the four main challenges people face as being: access, skills, motivation and trust.</p>
<h2>How we need to change</h2>
<p>To make sure the web is truly for everyone, we need to focus on more than just online access; we need to equip our residents with the skills, motivation and trust to go online, to be digitally capable and to make the most of the benefits the internet brings.</p>

<p>We will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide online access points at our front-of-house contact centres</li>
    <li>Encourage more people to try digital services by providing friendly advice and assistance to customers</li>
    <li>Ensure we provide support for those people who can’t use online services on their own</li>
    <li>Commit to improving the digital skills of our own staff</li>
    <li>Move all our websites to using secure protocols to provide a safer and more private browsing experience for our customers</li>
    <li>Ensure we design for accessibility, making our digital services easy to use first time to give customers greater confidence</li>
    <li>Work towards a four-star accessibility rating for Better Connected</li>
</ul>
