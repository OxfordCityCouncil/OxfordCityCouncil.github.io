<h2>Where we are now</h2>
<p>The drive to place more Council services online has been part of our Customer Contact strategy for some time, and we have made great progress to;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make access to our services easier</li>
    <li>Improve convenience and reduce waiting</li>
    <li>Be more efficient in dealing with requests</li>
    <li>Meet customer expectations for online services</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also improved how these online services are presented:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Our new website went live in January 2016 and is designed for all device types</li>
    <li>We have had a mobile app since 2015 which provides a range of services including bin collection day reminders and 'report it' forms</li>
    <li>The layout of the majority of our forms has been improved as a result of user testing and external advice.</li>
    <li>We have re-written all our web pages in plain English and made them shorter and more focused</li>
    <li>We are using Google Site Search to improve our customer search experience</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we need to change</h2>
<p>There is still significant potential for improving our performance and deliver better digital services. To achieve this step change we need to change the way we work.</p>
<p>We will:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure that we use a digital-first approach when improving or providing new services</li>
    <li>Design our digital services around our customersâ€™ needs first, through using excellent research, carrying out user testing and acting on feedback to make further improvements</li>
    <li>Encourage people to turn to digital services while being careful not to exclude those less able to use digital channels</li>
    <li>Improve our project delivery by using the most appropriate project management methods, and give our project teams the responsibility for making key project decisions</li>
    <li>Ensure we have the capacity, resources and technical flexibility to deliver new and improved digital services</li>
    <li>Identify appropriate performance measures for digital services to make sure they meet our expectations</li>
</ul>
